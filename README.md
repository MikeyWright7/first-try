# first-try
This project is my first attempt at a Full Stack Website. 
It was created while I was incarecerated and doing a code camp offered by Persevere 

# Technologies
I incorporated HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React for the Front End and used Axios for my middleware, and MongoDB for the Database. Server side technologies used are Mongoose and Express.js

# Overview of concept
My idea was to create an e-commerce site that could be an alternative source of shopping that would someday incorporate small businesses local to the users area. My knowledge base 
was limited in the restrictions of access to information because I was in prison. Upon turning this project in to my instructor, my original README was replaced by their rubric README. 
I created this on a closed sysytem and had no access to the internet and had to use their altered or imported node modules as well.
